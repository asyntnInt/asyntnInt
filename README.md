    HELLO FELLOW GITHUBERs! Have you somehow stumbled upon my profile? ... Anyways...
- Fell free to look around and enjoy my work, I guess?
- I really have no idea how I'm supposed to do this...
- Maybe-not-quite-so-fun-but-still-kinda-interesting-probably-fact: my username 'asyntnInt' was inspired by 'async' and 'int' and my own name, Natan!
